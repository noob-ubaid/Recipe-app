          ðŸŽ¯ The story behind the Recipe Book
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
          The idea for Recipe Book was born out of a simple yet powerful need â€”
          helping people cook with confidence and share their culinary
          creativity. During the COVID-19 lockdown, many people found themselves
          struggling to prepare meals at home, especially beginners and students
          living away from family. At the same time, passionate home cooks had
          limited ways to share their recipes with others. Seeing this gap, we
          created Recipe Book â€” a platform where anyone, regardless of skill
          level, can find easy-to-follow recipes, learn cooking basics, and also
          contribute their own creations. What started as a small personal
          project has grown into a nationwide cooking community that celebrates
          the joy of home-cooked meals.
